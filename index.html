<!--Hello maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it--for this might be a really intersection on your way to becoming. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other, but explains a little more about the discourse communities that have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual. 

You could do it the easy way like I once did: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/ , or you can do a little more unconcealing...not just unconcealing who you are, but opening these tools that you use everyday, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to really understand our tools and how they work. So let's cut it all open--using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it...lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! 

In this doc., you will work through Gregory Ulmer's four discourses of family, entertainment, community, and schooling ((2002). Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy.) Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. I hope you are excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own Electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want--><!--this other stuff below the title does important work to help tell different browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we will need to make some changes on your style.css file. developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: simplify the name). Change the other relevant information, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"'--whatever that is?-->

  <h2>Family. Whether or not they share the blood in your veins is hardly relevant. They are the ones who are there for you for the highs and lows, whom you love most dearly, without whom life would be empty. Of course there is my biological family, Mom, Dad, and my sister little sister Tori. However, besides the family I was born with, there are the family members I chose. These are my two best friends, Noah and Alex, who have helped me mature into the person I am today. This is my girlfriend of two years, Hailee. In reality, it is not that long of a time, but she has already become one of the most important influences in my life. Finally, Buddy the cat and his mortal enemy (who really just wants to be his best friend) Jaxon. </h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Gregory Ulmer, who we discussed above, says that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person and how you language yourself. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You will have some opportunities to add video content or other content. You might add an image (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) or perhaps add a photo grid like the one you did for "Family." Experiment. You can't break this thing!

  <h2>The media I consume is highly reflective of the development of my attitudes, beliefs, and interests. Star Wars captured my childhood imaginiation and continues to do so today. As I got older, I became intersted in music. At first, I listened to whatever my dad did, mainly classic rock and metal , like Metallica's Master of Puppets. However, I have explored many new genres, bands, and albums, like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Billy Joel's The Stranger. Additionally, I consider Catch 22 my favorite book. Aside from its hilarity, it offered a unique perspective on about duty, honor, and war. Finally, I find this clip from Rocky Balboa extremely motivating and inspiational.</h2>

  <h2>I have lived my entire life in Pittsburgh, and consider the city to be a part of my identity. However, I would consider other communities to be more influential in my life. These include the communities described elsewhere on this page: school, family, and friends. It is within those groups that I feel at home, and where I spend most of my time. Looking ahead, i will likely find myself a member of the engineering communitywhen i enter the workforce. In a more abstract sense, I have started to learn to see myself as a part of the global community, and have begun to understand that my actions and experiences do not exist in a vacuum.</h2>

  <h2>I attended Bishop Canevin High School in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. Canevin is a small Catholic school, and this environment was very impactful for me. Since it was so small, I had the opportunity to be involved in a wide variety of activities, from soccer, to hockey, robotics, academic team, and more. Having such a well rounded experience has helped me appreciate the value of exploring new things and getting involved. Canevin also helped focus my interest in science and engineering, which is what led me to Pitt. I am currently in the Swanson School of Engineering, majoring in mechanical engineering. I hope that this will lead me to an eventual job in the aerospace industry. Additionally, I hope that my education will continue to help me develop as a person, not just as an employee. </h2>

***Add an image. 
To add an image, all you need to do is add the HTML, the CSS style has aleady been set. Just drop the following code between other <div></div> elements...and you will need to replace the stinky feet.jpg. 

***Small image: 

<div>
<img src="feet.jpg" alt="Paris" class="center-small-image" alt="my feet in water" style="width:50%;height:50%;">
</div>

***Large image:   

<div>
<img src="feet.jpg" alt="Paris" class="center-large-image" alt="my feet in water" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
</div>

***Add a photo grid:

    <div class="row"> 
  <div class="column">
    <img src="pgrid1.jpg" alt= decribe the image HERE for accessibility purposes>
    <img src="pgrid2.jpg" alt= decribe the image HERE for accessibility purposes>
